# Examples of the Solana on-chain programs
* [Ping](ping/src/lib.rs) - prints the "Ping" word in the Validator log.
* [Fail on Division](fail_on_division/src/lib.rs) - succedes or fails depending on the number division result. Handy to test the transaction failures.

Refer to Solana [Docs](https://solana.com/docs/programs/lang-rust) and [Tutorial](https://solana.com/developers/guides/getstarted/local-rust-hello-world#create-your-first-solana-program) for instructions how to build, deploy and run on-chain programs.
